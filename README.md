# Useful-Lisp-Scripts
A collection of Lisp Scripts I have made/am working on.

ScreenMovement basic documentation
when called it will wait for two inputs of integer nature, if they are not integer or the inputs do not match any conditionals the system will close peacefully. 
an input of 7 followed by 1 sets one screen, as does 8 followed by 1. 7 followed by 2 will jump to the first screen and 8 followed by 2 will jump to the second screen. 
Quietly closing the script upon conclusion. Likely best functionality would be reached when used in conjunction with a shortcut key/sequence to access the function.
